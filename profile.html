            <p class="profile-content">
                In February 2019 me and my wife made a big decision, we left everything behind and moved to Sweden to start a new life at
                 age 28. We were unsure of what was going to become of all this but we knew that staying in Serbia (where we were born)
                  was not something we would like to have as a future for us and our family. Everything was foreign to us at the start, and
                   we needed to learn a lot of new things from the ground up and adapt ourselves to new people and surroundings. It was a
                    fun and adventurous time for us, to say the least. It was us and our dog versus the world! 
            </p>
            <p class="profile-content">
                My family has a traditional business that my grandparents started back in the late 1960s that still works to this day. I have
                 worked there for ten years. it was a significant experience for me. I learned many things about myself, how to be proactive
                  and productive, how to manage time efficiently, and most importantly, what it means to be a dependant hard worker who knows how
                   to deal with stressful situations. If you are interested in more details about this part of my life, in particular, you can
                    download my CV.

            <p class="profile-content">
                As of December 2020, the year that got us all thinking a lot more about our future, I felt like it was time for a change
                 since I was not happy with the way my career path was going. So I decided to enroll in Code Institute's course to gain a
                  Diploma in Software Development by upskilling in becoming a Full Stack Website Developer! I feel like today we're living
                   in the Information Age. And with a huge convergency for web apps and systems, great on-premises platforms are turning
                    into cloud available applications. All this change, plus those new services which already are born into the web
                     ecosystem, put the front-end developer role in evidence, leading to a huge demand for new trained developers to manage
                      this all. That being said, I feel like this is the right decision for me, even though I have a really long way to go to
                       achieve the goals I have set out for myself and my future.
