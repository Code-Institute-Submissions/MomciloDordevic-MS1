This website presents Momcilo's professional portfolio as a fictional Front-End / Full-Stack Developer.
The goal is for the user to find interesting and informative content in a easy and simple way.

This project is for education purposes only and the main aim is to build a responsive website with HTML and CSS only.
I will also use Bootstrap framework to keep the website simple and clear.
